Visual Memory Test

The visual memory test consists of images of shapes in different colours, arranged in grids.
The grid will briefly display for the user to view, after which the image disappears.
The user will need to answer a series of simple questions on the grids (e.g. which shape was red?).
The test focuses on the short-term visual memory of the user.

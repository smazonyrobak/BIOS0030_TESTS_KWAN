Welcome to the Spatial Reasoning Test!
In this test you will be showed a 3D projection of coloured cubes.
You will then be showed the same coloured cubes but from 4 different views. One of the displayed options will not be a rotation of the initial 3D projection and it is your job to figure out which one is wrong.
